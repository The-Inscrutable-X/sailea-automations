    "\n",
    "SAILea is a nonprofit organization led by college students at Duke, UNC, and Georgia Tech. From our experiences in research and industry, our leadership team has seen the tremendous power of artificial intelligence to transform various occupations. We are also excited by how AI tools like ChatGPT, when ethically deployed, can lead to enhanced productivity and learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the ongoing rise of artificial intelligence, we believe that it is essential for students to be exposed to AI in high school so they can be prepared for their future careers and learn to maximize the benefits of this new technology. At SAILea, our goal is to spread AI to high schools across the United States by providing students with resources, courses, mentorship, and live events to fuel their AI journeys. \n",
    "\n",
    "We work closely with individual high schoolers and Computer Science/AI clubs with a wide array of skill levels, from just learning to code to already having built AI models, taking a personalized approach to meet the needs of each student/club. \n",
    "\n",
    "We’re looking to expand our impact, and would appreciate it if you could pass along this information about SAILea to teachers and students at your school who are interested in technology. Please encourage them to join us on our website (sailea.org), and we’ll be certain to provide them with plenty of opportunities to learn and get more involved in our high school AI community.\n",
